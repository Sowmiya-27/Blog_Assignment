Project Title: My Personal Blog
Overview:
"My Personal Blog" is a personal blogging application developed using Django, a high-level Python web framework.
Each blog entry is presented with metadata including the title, date of publication, category, and a featured image where applicable.

Technologies Used:
The application is developed using Python and Django for backend logic, HTML and CSS for frontend structure and styling, and SQLite as the database engine.
Django's built-in development server (running at 127.0.0.1:8000) is used to test and run the application locally.

Project Structure:
The project directory consists of two primary components: the Django project configuration (mysite) and the application module (blog).
The blog app includes templates, static files, models, views, and URL configurations. 

Conclusion:
It provides a foundation that can be extended with features such as user authentication, commenting, or post management.
